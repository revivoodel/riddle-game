# Riddle Game - JavaScript Terminal Project

A terminal game that asks the player riddles, measures how long each riddle took, and shows statistics at the end.

This repository is a **template**. The folders and files are ready, and every file has a comment that describes what should be written in it. Write all the code yourself.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` (this installs `prompt-sync`).
3. Fill in each file according to the comment inside it.
4. Run the game with `node app.js` directly in the terminal (not through a piped command).

## Folder structure

```
riddle-game/
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── riddles/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── r1.js
│   ├── r2.js
│   ├── r3.js
│   ├── r4.js
│   └── r5.js
└── classes/
    ├── Riddle.js
    └── Player.js
```

## Tasks

### Riddle files

**Task 1: Create the riddles** (`riddles/r1.js` to `riddles/r5.js`)

- Each file exports a riddle object with `id`, `name`, `taskDescription` and `correctAnswer`.
- Example:

```js
// riddles/r1.js
export default {
  id: 1,
  name: "Easy Math",
  taskDescription: "What is 5 + 3?",
  correctAnswer: "8"
};
```

- Write 5 riddles of your own.

**Task 2: Load all riddles at once** (`riddles/index.js`)

- Import all five riddles and export them together as one array.

### Classes

**Task 3: The Riddle class** (`classes/Riddle.js`)

- Properties: `id`, `name`, `taskDescription`, `correctAnswer`.
- Method `ask(prompt)`:
  - Show the riddle.
  - Ask for user input.
  - Keep asking until the correct answer is given.

**Task 4: The Player class** (`classes/Player.js`)

- Properties: `name`, `times[]` (array of time durations per riddle).
- Methods:
  - `recordTime(start, end)`
  - `showStats()` - show total and average time.

### Game logic (`app.js`)

**Task 5: Set up terminal input**

- Install `prompt-sync` (already listed in `package.json`, so `npm install` is enough).
- Set it up:

```js
import PromptSync from 'prompt-sync';
const prompt = PromptSync();
```

**Task 6: Ask for the player name**

- Show a welcome message.
- Use `prompt` to ask: "What is your name?"
- Create a `Player` object with the name.

**Task 7: Use all the riddles**

- In `app.js`, import the array from `riddles/index.js`.

**Task 8: Main game loop**

- Loop through all riddles:
  - Record `startTime` with `Date.now()`.
  - Create a `Riddle` object and call `ask()`.
  - Record `endTime`.
  - Save the time using `player.recordTime()`.

**Task 9: Show final stats**

- After all riddles:
  - Show total time.
  - Show average time per riddle.

### Bonus (optional)

**Task 10: Multiple choice riddles**

- Create a `MultipleChoiceRiddle` class that inherits from `Riddle`.
- Add a `choices[]` property.
- Show numbered options.
- Accept numeric input and compare it to the correct answer.
- Create the file `classes/MultipleChoiceRiddle.js` yourself.

## Final deliverables

- Project folders and files ready.
- 5 riddles defined.
- Working `Riddle` and `Player` classes.
- `app.js` runs the full game.
- Terminal input with `prompt-sync`.
- Time tracking for each riddle.
- Final stats display.
- Optional: multiple choice riddles.

# Part 2: Database & New Features

We are improving the Riddle Game: the riddles and the players will be saved in a database, and the game gets a main menu, CRUD options for riddles, a "time to beat" and a leaderboard.

The database is a local server called **json-server**. It reads one file, `db.json`, and turns every array in it into an API address. Your code talks to it **only with `fetch`**, exactly like any other API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

## Getting started (Part 2)

1. Install json-server (once):

```
npm install json-server@0.17.4
```

2. Add a script to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 3000"
}
```

3. Open **two terminals**:
   - Terminal 1: `npm run server` (keep it open, this is the database).
   - Terminal 2: `node app.js` (the game).

4. Check that the server works: open http://localhost:3000/riddles in the browser. You should see your riddles as JSON.

## New folder structure

```
riddle-game/
├── app.js
├── db.json            <- new: the database
├── package.json
├── api/               <- new: all the fetch calls
│   ├── riddlesApi.js
│   └── playersApi.js
└── classes/
    ├── Riddle.js
    └── Player.js
```

The `riddles/` folder is not needed anymore. The riddles now live in `db.json`.

## The API

json-server gives you these addresses automatically:

| Method | Address | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/riddles` | Get all riddles |
| GET | `/riddles/1` | Get the riddle with id 1 |
| POST | `/riddles` | Add a new riddle (json-server creates the `id` by itself) |
| PUT | `/riddles/1` | Replace the riddle with id 1 |
| DELETE | `/riddles/1` | Delete the riddle with id 1 |
| GET | `/players?name=Yishai` | Find players by name (returns an array) |

The same addresses exist for `/players`.

Remember:
- `fetch` returns a Promise. Use `async` / `await` (or `.then()`).
- Check `res.ok`. `fetch` does not throw an error on 404 or 500.
- For POST and PUT send `headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }` and `body: JSON.stringify(...)`.
- Use `try` / `catch`, so the game shows a clear message if the server is not running.
- `app.js` is an ES module, so you can use `await` directly at the top level of the file.

## Tasks

**Task 11: Riddle database** (`db.json`)

- Move all your riddles from `r1.js` ... `r5.js` into one file, as an array of objects.
- Example:

```json
{
  "riddles": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Easy Math",
      "taskDescription": "What is 5 + 3?",
      "correctAnswer": "8"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Riddle of Sound",
      "taskDescription": "I speak without a mouth. What am I?",
      "correctAnswer": "echo"
    }
  ],
  "players": []
}
```

- `db.json` must be valid JSON (double quotes, no comma after the last item).
- Delete the `riddles/` folder and load the riddles from the server instead.

**Task 12: Riddles API** (`api/riddlesApi.js`)

- Write and export an `async` function for every action:
  - `getAllRiddles()`
  - `createRiddle(riddle)`
  - `updateRiddle(id, riddle)`
  - `deleteRiddle(id)`
- Each function uses `fetch` with the right method and returns the data from the server.

**Task 13: Main menu** (`app.js`)

- Show a menu and keep showing it until the player chooses to exit:

```
What do you want to do?
1. Play the game
2. Create a new riddle
3. Read all riddles
4. Update an existing riddle
5. Delete a riddle
6. View leaderboard
0. Exit
```

**Task 14: Riddle CRUD options**

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Create | Ask for name, description and answer, and add the new riddle to the DB |
| Read | Show all riddles in the DB |
| Update | Ask for an ID and change the details of that riddle |
| Delete | Ask for an ID and remove that riddle |

- Example - creating a new riddle:

```
Enter riddle name: Hard Math
Enter description: What is 12 x 12?
Enter correct answer: 144
Riddle saved!
```

**Task 15: Player database** (`db.json` + `api/playersApi.js`)

- The `players` array in `db.json` keeps every player and their best time (in seconds):

```json
"players": [
  { "id": 1, "name": "Yishai", "lowestTime": 72 },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Sarah", "lowestTime": 65 }
]
```

- In `api/playersApi.js` write and export:
  - `findPlayerByName(name)` - returns the player, or `undefined` if there is no such player
  - `createPlayer(name)` - adds a new player with `lowestTime: null`
  - `updatePlayer(player)` - saves the player's new `lowestTime`
  - `getAllPlayers()`

**Task 16: Show "Time to Beat"**

- When a player starts a game:
  - Check if they already exist in the players DB.
  - If they do and they have a time, show:

```
Hi Yishai! Your previous lowest time was 72 seconds.
```

  - If not, add them to the DB with no `lowestTime` yet (`null`).

**Task 17: Update player time**

- After finishing the game:
  - If the player has no recorded time, save their time.
  - If their current time is lower than their saved `lowestTime`, update it.
- Example:

```
Great job, Yishai!
Your time: 68 seconds
New record! Time updated.
```

**Task 18: Leaderboard** (menu option 6)

- Load all players from the DB.
- Skip players who never finished a game (`lowestTime` is `null`).
- Sort by `lowestTime` ascending (fastest first).
- Show the results:

```
🏆 Leaderboard:
1. Sarah - 65 seconds
2. Yishai - 68 seconds
```

## Part 2 deliverables

- All riddles in one database file (`db.json`), served by json-server.
- All database actions done with `fetch` from the `api/` folder.
- A main menu with CRUD options for riddles.
- A player database.
- "Time to beat" shown before playing.
- The player's best time updated after playing.
- A leaderboard sorted by best time.

# Part 3: Server Refactor with Express

Until now json-server was the database server. In Part 3 you write **your own server with Express** and stop using json-server.

The game in the terminal becomes the **client**: it shows the menu, asks the player for input, and sends HTTP requests with `fetch`, exactly like in Part 2. The **server** gets the requests, reads and writes the database file, and sends back JSON.

The database stays the same `db.json` from Part 2, with the `riddles` and `players` arrays. Only the server that reads it changes.

```
Client (app.js)  --fetch-->  Express server (server.js)  -->  routes (riddles.js / players.js)  -->  read / write db.json
       ^                                                                                                    |
       +----------------------------------------- JSON response -----------------------------------------+
```

## Getting started (Part 3)

1. Stop json-server (`Ctrl + C` in its terminal) and remove it:

```
npm uninstall json-server
```

2. Install Express:

```
npm install express
```

3. Change the scripts in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "server": "node server/server.js",
  "start": "node client/app.js"
}
```

4. Open **two terminals**, like in Part 2:
   - Terminal 1: `npm run server` (keep it open, this is your server).
   - Terminal 2: `npm start` (the game).

5. Check that the server works: open http://localhost:3000/api/riddles in the browser. You should see your riddles as JSON.

## New folder structure

Move the files into two folders, `client` and `server`. The folder structure is optional, but the tasks below use it.

```
riddle-game/
├── package.json
├── client/
│   ├── app.js              <- the terminal menu, sends HTTP requests
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── riddlesApi.js
│   │   └── playersApi.js
│   └── classes/
│       ├── Riddle.js
│       └── Player.js
└── server/
    ├── server.js           <- the Express server
    ├── routes/
    │   ├── riddles.js
    │   └── players.js
    └── db/
        ├── db.json         <- moved here from Part 2 (riddles + players)
        └── dbHelpers.js    <- readDb() and writeDb()
```

Move `app.js`, `api/` and `classes/` together into `client/`, so the imports inside them keep working.

## The server API

Your server must answer these requests. All addresses start with `/api`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/riddles` | Get all riddles |
| GET | `/api/riddles/:id` | Get one riddle by ID (404 if it does not exist) |
| POST | `/api/riddles` | Add a new riddle (the server creates the `id`) |
| PUT | `/api/riddles/:id` | Update a riddle by ID (404 if it does not exist) |
| DELETE | `/api/riddles/:id` | Delete a riddle by ID (404 if it does not exist) |
| GET | `/api/players` | Get all players |
| GET | `/api/players?name=Yishai` | Find players by name (returns an array) |
| POST | `/api/players` | Add a new player (`lowestTime: null`) |
| PUT | `/api/players/:id` | Update the player's best time |

These are the same requests json-server answered in Part 2, with `/api` at the start. That is why the client almost does not change.

## Tasks

### Server side

**Task 19: Create the Express app** (`server/server.js`)

- Create the app with `express()`.
- Add `app.use(express.json())`, so the server can read the JSON body of POST and PUT requests.
- Connect the routers: `/api/riddles` to `routes/riddles.js` and `/api/players` to `routes/players.js`.
- Listen on port `3000` and print `Server is running on http://localhost:3000`.

**Task 20: Read and write the database** (`server/db/dbHelpers.js`)

- Write and export two `async` functions with `fs.promises` (`import fs from 'fs/promises'`):
  - `readDb()` - reads `db.json` and returns the object (`JSON.parse`).
  - `writeDb(db)` - saves the object back to `db.json` (`JSON.stringify(db, null, 2)`).
- The routes always read the whole file, change the right array (`db.riddles` or `db.players`), and write the whole file back.

**Task 21: Riddles routes** (`server/routes/riddles.js`)

- Create a router with `express.Router()` and export it.
- Add a route for every riddles row in the table above.
- `req.params.id` is a string, so convert it with `Number()` before you compare it to `id`.
- POST: the new `id` is the biggest `id` in the array + 1. Answer with status `201` and the new riddle.
- PUT and DELETE: if there is no riddle with this `id`, answer with status `404` and `{ "error": "Riddle not found" }`.

**Task 22: Players routes** (`server/routes/players.js`)

- Create a router with `express.Router()` and export it.
- GET `/`: if there is a `name` in the query (`req.query.name`), return only the players with that name. Otherwise return all players.
- POST `/`: add `{ id, name, lowestTime: null }`, answer with status `201` and the new player.
- PUT `/:id`: save the player's new `lowestTime`, or answer `404` if the player does not exist.

### Client side

**Task 23: Connect the client to your server** (`client/api/riddlesApi.js`, `client/api/playersApi.js`)

- Change the addresses:
  - `http://localhost:3000/riddles` → `http://localhost:3000/api/riddles`
  - `http://localhost:3000/players` → `http://localhost:3000/api/players`
- The rest of the client stays the same: the menu, the game, and the `fetch` calls with `res.ok` checks.
- Check every menu option again: play, create, read, update, delete, and the leaderboard.

### Bonus (optional)

**Task 24: Validation on the server**

- POST and PUT `/api/riddles`: if `name`, `taskDescription` or `correctAnswer` is missing, answer with status `400` and `{ "error": "..." }`, and do not save.
- POST `/api/players`: if `name` is missing, answer with status `400`.

## Part 3 deliverables

- json-server is removed, and an Express server runs with `npm run server`.
- `client/` and `server/` folders.
- All the routes in the table above, reading and writing `db.json` with `fs.promises`.
- `404` answers for an ID that does not exist.
- The client works exactly like in Part 2, only through your own server.
